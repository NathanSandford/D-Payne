'''
This code reads in a batch of very high resolution spectra and degrades them
to a lower resolution, assuming a Gaussian line-spread function. The main use
case is that we produce synthetic spectra (from an updated version of the Kurucz 
line list by default) at R~300,000 and need to convolve them the resolution of 
APOGEE before training the NN spectral model. Note, the high-res spectra are not
normalized.
If we were doing ab-initio fitting, it would be important to use the correct
(non-Gaussian) LSF from APOGEE, but since we just use the synthetic spectral
model to predict the continuum, this isn't important. 
For a few hundred ab-initio spectra, this runs on my laptop in a minute or two. 
I have not included the high-res model spectra that this operates on, as they're 
big files, but they're available up request if an example is needed.
